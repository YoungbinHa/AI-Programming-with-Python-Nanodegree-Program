# AI-Programming-with-Python-Nanodegree-Program-proj1

 My first project on Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Program. In this projext, I practice the basic syntaxa and concept of python with Dog classifier.
I built the functions that classify the dog images and identify which pet images are of dogs and which pet images aren't of dogs.
